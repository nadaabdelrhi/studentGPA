# 🎓 Student GPA Calculator (C++ OOP Project)

This is my first C++ OOP mini-project!  
It’s a simple console-based program that calculates and displays each student's GPA, and keeps track of the number of students.

## 🛠️ Features
- Add multiple students and store their information.
- Calculate GPA based on grades entered.
- Count the total number of students using static members.
- Apply object-oriented concepts like:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Constructor Overloading
  - Destructor
  - Static Members
  - Passing Objects as Arguments

## 📚 Technologies
- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio

## 📌 Note
This is a beginner-level project made for learning purposes and applying what I’ve learned in OOP.  
I’m still exploring more topics and improving every day!

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add file storage to save students’ data.
- Build a simple menu system for easier interaction.
- Add error handling.
